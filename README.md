# GroupCapstone-Dysprosium

This project has to do with people being able to talk to one another in the app while also being able to look up places they would want to visit using the Yelp API. They are able to talk between one another using the Pusher API. Users can take the location and put it directly into the chat so that everyone in the chat can click on it to look at exactly which one they are talking about since the Yelp API can bring in places all around the world.
